# Travel Time

A fun tool for finding the travel times between locations for a variety of travelers, from animals to man-made machines.

## Note
These travel times are calculated using the given traveler's average top speed and may be misleading. For example a cheetah cannot run at top speed for more than about 30 seconds, so longer routes at this speed are just for visualization and not an accurate representation of how long it would take a cheetah to travel that distance. Another example is the ISS, which is traveling at a much higher altitude than represented here. While this app may show the ISS as traveling across the European continent in around 4 minutes, in reality it is traveling in a wide arc over the Earth making this flight take slightly longer in real life. Also, this app using walking directions as provided by Google Maps, so some of these routes may not be possible for certain travelers such as cars and planes. That being said, have fun!

TODO:
    Add popup for each traveler talking about its speed (i.e. Pigeons have been known to travel up to 90mph, but on average fly at around 60)
    Upload to railway or some platform
    Add to portfolio/resume
